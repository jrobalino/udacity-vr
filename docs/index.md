# Udacity VR Nanodegree - Javier Robalino
This page documents the projects completed for my Udacity VR Nanodegree program.

## Project 4: Puzzler
Puzzler is a mobile VR game that tests a player's visual memory skills. The game takes place within a mysterious dungeon, where orbs light up in a random pattern. To exit the dungeon, the player must reproduce the correct sequence in which the orbs light up.

### Design Emphasis
This project emphasizes the importance of VR design methodology. After completing this project, I gained a greater understanding of:

* User Personas
* Ergonomics
* Field of View
* Text: Clarity, Face, Distance
* Simulator Sickness
* Motion Paradigms
* Prototyping
* Scale
* Mood (Lighting and Audio)
* User Testing
* Iterative Design
* Documentation

### Process
> __*Statement of Purpose:*__ Puzzler is a mobile VR application that challenges new VR users to solve a familiar of puzzle in a new way.

### User Testing
The main goals of user testing were to ensure:

* The scale of the dungeon gave the player the sense of normal human height.
* The environment was perceived as mysterious or spooky.
* The motion system did not induce simulator sickness.
* The player understood how to play the game.
* The player understood how to restart the game.

### Breakdown of Final Piece
By way of an iterative design process, the final game features the following components:
(add screenshots)

#### Snowy, Wind-Scourged Environment
snow, wind audio, bare trees, green lights, tinted mountain skybox

#### UI System Built into the Environment
wooden signs to start and restart the game

#### Linear Motion System
slowed down to seven seconds

#### Game Mechanics Bolstered by Audio and Video
orbs light up with particle effects and sounds, audio confirms a correct choice or not and a win game sound, event system disabled when you need to wait for the pattern

#### Scoring System
how many times it took you to pass the game

#### Adjustable Game Settings
puzzle speed and length

#### Conclusion
Blah

#### Next Steps
Probably more instructions
