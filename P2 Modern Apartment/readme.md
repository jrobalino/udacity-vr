### Time to Complete Project
6-7 hours

### GoogleVR Version
I used the version that came bundled with the VRND Course 2 Course Assets starter pack.

### What I Liked
I liked seeing the effects of lights on the scene after baking. The (sometimes) subtle differences between the options didn't sink in until I got to the hands-on portion.
### What I Didn't Like
When I first deployed the project to iOS via Xcode, the screen was black (despite running perfectly on Unity). I found a [post on the Udacity forums](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/black-screen-strobe-screen-after-deploying-to-ios/199288) in which another user had a similar problem, so as described in the post, I simplified the teleportation script and this solved the black screen problem. To prevent future users from having this problem and wasting time, this bug should be fixed.
