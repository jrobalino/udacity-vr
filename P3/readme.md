### Time to Complete Project
10 hours

### GoogleVR Version
I used the version that came bundled with the Course 3 starter pack.

### What I Liked
Creating scripts to keep track of the coins and to register whether the door should open demonstrated the exciting power of scripting.
### What I Didn't Like
It took a long time to bake the lighting the first time around (it took nearly an hour and my computer is top of the line). This might be a recent Unity issue given some things I read on the internet, but some context for this issue would be appreciated if you have it.
