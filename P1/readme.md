### Time to Complete Project
2 hrs to go through material.
3 hrs to code.
2 days to figure out how to deploy to iPhone from a Windows computer.
### What I Liked
I liked having a starter script as a foundation for customizing my first project.
### What I Didn't Like
It was difficult to deploy the project from Windows to iPhone. I understand this is an issue with the Apple ecosystem, but the course requirements might should mention the possible difficulty.
