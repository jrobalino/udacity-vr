-Results of User Test (move camera up, lower ambient lighting)
	Dungeon not necessarily mysterious: changed torch lights to green and lowered brightness
	Feel smaller than normal: raised camera
-Results of User Test (change skybox)
	I'm in a bright place in the mountains: change tint settings for skybox to give more of a dusk feel
-Results of User Test (motion)
	Rusty was new to Cardboard and felt sick in general. Lower speed of translation and add trees to control the periphery
	Stuart didn't have any issues
	Trini felt like ducking under the gate. I want the gate to have a little of this effect but not so much so I raised it
-Results of User Test (add repeatability)
	Is that it? Does it restart? Add score board and adjustable settings to make the game more interesting
