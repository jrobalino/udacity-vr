Budget:

By 2025, Goldman Sachs conservatively estimates the revenue for virtual and augmented reality software in education to be seven hundred million dollars per year. The estimate assumes educational VR solutions will sell at a pace of eight million units in the first five years, reaching an installed user base of fifteen million students by 2025. The current number of primary and secondary school students in the developed world is far greater than that number at two hundred million, which means that virtual reality has a lot of room to grow within the education sector.

Teacher Surveys:

Over one thousand K through twelve teachers were surveyed to determine what teachers have to say about whether virtual reality is ready for the classroom. 85 percent of teachers agreed that virtual reality would have a positive effect on students, and 2 percent of teachers were already using virtual reality content in their classrooms. 72 percent of teachers would like to use virtual reality to simulate experiences relevant to course content, such as flying alongside the Wright Brothers during their historic flight. 68 percent would like to explore otherwise inaccessible locations like outer space. 69 percent would like to travel to distant landmarks around the world like the great pyramids of Egypt. 68 percent would like to supplement course curriculum to help students better understand concepts within science and math. As far as teachers were concerned, the subjects that virtual reality could provide the greatest benefit to were science, history, and social studies. Overall, 83 percent of teachers think that virtual reality can help improve learning outcomes in a classroom setting, while also increasing student motivation. However, only 36 percent of teachers expect their school to adopt virtual reality in less than five years, and 28 percent of teachers think it will never happen.
