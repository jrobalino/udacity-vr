### Time to Complete Project
30 hours

### GoogleVR Version
I used the version that came bundled with the Course 3 starter pack.

### What I Liked
I found it very valuable to research an industry I am interested in with regards to VR and discover actual facts, figures, and use cases I didn't know about before.
### What I Didn't Like
I got slightly sidetracked trying to play videos on a panel element before learning that Unity does not support movie textures for mobile devices unless you purchase a third-party plugin. The project rubric might note this so students know what they are getting themselves into before they attempt to add videos to their projects.
